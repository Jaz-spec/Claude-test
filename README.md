# Weather App Workshop
This is a minimal full-stack weather application built with Node.js (Express) and vanilla JavaScript. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate core full-stack concepts without unnecessary complexity.

# Workshop Aims
- To explore an AI workflow using Codex CLI to write code
- To use AI to navigate learning 

# What you're building
Use AI to help you build a user interface for a weather app - The aim is for you to direct codex in writing most of your code. Your job is to direct and review the code

The backend of this codebase is set up for you and provides some dummy weather data to the front end (where you'll be working)

# Workflow 

## At the Start:
1. Have an introductory conversation to establish you're current knowledge base -> "Let's establish my knowledge base"
2. If you are unfamiliar with the file structure of the project you could also start by asking some learning questions like "can you explain the project structure to me"
