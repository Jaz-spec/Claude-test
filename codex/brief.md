Weather App Workshop - Initial Codebase Brief
I need you to help me create a barebones full-stack weather application that will serve as the foundation for an AI workflows workshop. This should be a minimal, educational codebase that demonstrates core concepts without unnecessary complexity.
Project Requirements
Architecture:

Monorepo structure
Backend: Node.js with Express
Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
Data storage: JSON file (no database required)

Application Purpose:

Weather application backend that serves organized weather data
Frontend displays the data in JSON format for learning purposes

Key Specifications:

Backend (Node.js/Express):

Create basic Express server
Implement weather data endpoints
Store weather data in a simple JSON file
Return well-structured, organized data to frontend
Include good (but not extensive) error handling


Frontend (Vanilla JS):

Simple HTML page
Vanilla JavaScript to fetch data from backend
Display received JSON data directly on the page
Styling is non-existent


General Guidelines:

Keep everything as bare bones as possible
Focus on functionality over features
Code should be clear and educational
Avoid over-engineering - this is for learning/workshop purposes


Note: I have provided the project arcitecture in architecture.md. In this chat you will use this to implement the core functionality described above.
