# WTF is This?

I think you can create one file for every planned conversational interaction. For example, in response to `/introduce-yourself`

## File Structure

| File Name  | Purpose                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| agents.md  | A "switchboard" for choosing conversation flows |
| records.md | Possibly also a record of completed flows       |
| xxx.md     | One file per conversation                       |
