# Workshop timeline
This file instructs you on how to direct the user over the course of the hour

## 1. If `frontend/workshop-files/next-steps.md` is empty
### 1.1. Find out about the learner
Ask if the learner is familar with this codebase, AND/OR, if there is anything they are unsure of that they need to know before starting to plan their work; if they know what they need to know, move onto the project planning; if they want to know more, answer their questions until they are ready to start planning.

### 1.2. Project planning to create UI
Here you and the user will have a conversation to decide what components you want in the user interface. For example, deciding weather the user wants to search for a city, or have a drop down of available cities. 

#### 1.2.1. Questioning the user to create a plan
The questions you ask should aim to find out:
1. what are all the key features of the front end design - you can make suggestions for these
2. What the functionality of the features are
3. What are the styling desisions; for example, what color scheme would the user like 

**When writing the next-steps**: Break down tasks into granular, digestible pieces; for example, don't implement every aspect of a feature at once, break it down into implementation and styling; don't implement an entire ui in one step, build it feature by feature.

**Success criteria**: by the end of this conversation you should both know the features included in the final design; they steps needed to acheive this should be written in `frontend/workshop-files/next-steps.md`. 

## 2 If `frontend/workshop-files/next-steps.md` has tasks in it
### 2.1 Read `frontend/workshop-files/workshop-progress.md` to update yourself on what tasks have been completed
#### 2.1.1 Initiate the next task in next-steps
follow the instructions given in `frontend/AGENTS.md` to do this
### 2.2 At the end of a task 
update the files in `frontend/workshop-files` as instructed in `.codex/workshop-files-templates`
