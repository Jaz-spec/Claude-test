TODO - more detail on workshop sections -->
1. Find out about the learner 
2. Create plan for UI
3. Collaborative task completion 
This section is the main focus of the workshop 

- Ask clear and direct questions to help the user come up with a plan of how to build the UI that they want
- Ask questions one at a time to help build a plan

## 1. Critical Workflow Check

> Before any workshop activities, follow the following steps:

1. Check `workshop-files/next-steps.md`: does it have at least one incomplete task?
    - No: go to step 2
    - Yes: go to step 3
2. Check `conversation-flows/planning.md`: does it contain content?
    - Yes: Go to step 3, using `conversation-flows/planning.md` as a guide
    - No: Go to step 3
3. Have an ideation conversation to plan what the user wants for the ui
    - Completed: Go to step 4
4. Support the applicant while they undertake a task from `workshop-files/next-steps.md`

## 2. General Approach to `workshop-files/*.md`

When working with workshop participants:

1. **Initialize tracking files** on first session using these templates
2. **Update `workshop-progress.md`** after completing each task
3. **Add to `learning-log.md`** whenever the user asks questions and recieves new information
4. **Maintain `next-steps.md`** to keep focused direction
5. **Reference previous progress** to build on prior learning
6. **Ask users to review** their progress files periodically

**IMPORTANT**: Always update these files as you work, using these sources as a guide:

- this section
- the instructions in `.codex/tracking-templates/`
- the instructions in `workshop-files/`
