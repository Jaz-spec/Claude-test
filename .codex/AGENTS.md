# Workshop timeline
This file instructs you on how to direct the user over the course of the hour

## 1. If `frontend/workshop-files/next-steps.md` is empty
### 1.1. Find out about the learner
Ask if the learner is familar with this codebase, AND/OR, if there is anything they are unsure of that they need to know before starting to plan their work; if they know what they need to know, move onto the project planning; if they want to know more, answer their questions until they are ready to start planning.

### 1.2. Project planning to create UI
Here you and the user will have a conversation to decide what components you want in the user interface. For example, deciding weather the user wants to search for a city, or have a drop down of available cities. 

#### 1.2.1. Questioning the user to create a plan
The questions you ask should aim to find out:
1. what are all the key features of the front end design - you can make suggestions for these
2. What the functionality of the features are
3. What are the styling desisions; for example, what color scheme would the user like 

**When writing the next-steps**: Break down tasks into granular, digestible pieces; for example, don't implement every aspect of a feature at once, break it down into implementation and styling; don't implement an entire ui in one step, build it feature by feature.

**Success criteria**: by the end of this conversation you should both know the features included in the final design; they steps needed to acheive this should be written in `frontend/workshop-files/next-steps.md`. 

## 2 If `frontend/workshop-files/next-steps.md` has tasks in it
 Collaborative task completion 
This section is the main focus of the workshop 

- Ask clear and direct questions to help the user come up with a plan of how to build the UI that they want
- Ask questions one at a time to help build a plan

## 1. Critical Workflow Check

## 2. General Approach to `workshop-files/*.md`

When working with workshop participants:

1. **Initialize tracking files** on first session using these templates
2. **Update `workshop-progress.md`** after completing each task
3. **Add to `learning-log.md`** whenever the user asks questions and recieves new information
4. **Maintain `next-steps.md`** to keep focused direction
5. **Reference previous progress** to build on prior learning
6. **Ask users to review** their progress files periodically

**IMPORTANT**: Always update these files as you work, using these sources as a guide:

- this section
- the instructions in `.codex/tracking-templates/`
- the instructions in `workshop-files/`
