## Instructions for Codex

CRITICAL WORKFLOW CHECK: Before any workshop activities:

Check if next-steps.md exists and has content
If empty or missing, initiate planning conversation from project instructions
Have an ideation conversation to plan what the user wants for the ui. Ask clear and direct questions to help the user come up with a plan of how to build the UI that they want. Asl questions one at a time to help build a plan. 
Only proceed with coding after planning is complete and a list of next steps have been written

When working with workshop participants:

1. **Initialize tracking files** on first session using these templates
2. **Update `workshop-progress.md`** after completing each task
3. **Add to `learnings-log.md`** whenever the user asks questions and recieves new information
4. **Maintain `next-steps.md`** to keep focused direction
5. **Reference previous progress** to build on prior learning
6. **Ask users to review** their progress files periodically
