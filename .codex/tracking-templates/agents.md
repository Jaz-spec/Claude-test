# Instructions: Using `tracking-templates/*.md`

## 1. Critical Workflow Check

> Before any workshop activities:

- [ ] Check if `tracking-templates/next-steps.md` exists and has content
    - [ ] If empty or missing, initiate `conversation-flows/planning.md` from project instructions
- [ ] Have an ideation conversation to plan what the user wants for the ui.
    - Ask clear and direct questions to help the user come up with a plan of how to build the UI that they want
    - Ask questions one at a time to help build a plan
- [ ] Only proceed with coding after `tracking-templates/next-steps.md` has been completed with a list of next steps

## 2. General Approach to `tracking-templates/*.md`

When working with workshop participants:

1. **Initialize tracking files** on first session using these templates
2. **Update `workshop-progress.md`** after completing each task
3. **Add to `learning-log.md`** whenever the user asks questions and recieves new information
4. **Maintain `next-steps.md`** to keep focused direction
5. **Reference previous progress** to build on prior learning
6. **Ask users to review** their progress files periodically
